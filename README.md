## ðŸ“¦ Project Description

This project leverages data visualization techniques using Tableau to analyze and optimize food delivery operations for a major delivery platform in India. By analyzing data such as delivery times, vehicle conditions, traffic density, and weather patterns, it identifies key operational inefficiencies and provides actionable insights for improving delivery performance. The project employs various visualization tools including Box Plots, Line Charts, Bar Charts, Heatmaps, and Choropleth Maps to explore business questions such as average delivery time analysis, vehicle performance, delivery agent allocation, and regional demand patterns.

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about delivery operations, including demographic data of delivery agents, order timing details, and environmental factors affecting delivery efficiency.

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Features:
- Analysis of delivery time under varying weather conditions using Box Plots.
- What-If Analysis to simulate order volume surge and staffing requirements.
- Visualization of delivery volume segmented by vehicle type and condition.
- Heatmap visualization of average delivery time segmented by vehicle condition.
- State-wise mapping of delivery volumes using Choropleth Maps.
- Ethical considerations related to data privacy, performance metrics, and algorithmic transparency.

### Project Overview:
This data visualization project utilizes Tableau to analyze the operational efficiency of food delivery services. By examining the impact of various factors like traffic, vehicle conditions, and weather, the project identifies key areas for operational improvement and strategic planning.

### Project Structure:
- **Data Preparation:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and geospatial enrichment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of delivery times, traffic conditions, and vehicle performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards to address specific business problems.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Addressing data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and responsible metric use.

### Key Visualizations:
- Box Plots for delivery time analysis.
- Line Charts for weekly delivery volume analysis.
- Bar Charts for vehicle type performance analysis.
- Heatmaps for vehicle condition impact.
- Choropleth Maps for state-wise delivery distribution.
